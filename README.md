## 🎮 Overview

The Knight's Tour is a classic chess puzzle where a knight must visit every square on a chessboard exactly once. This project uses a genetic algorithm to find solutions and provides a beautiful visual interface to explore the results.

## ✨ Features

- **Genetic Algorithm Implementation**: Efficiently finds Knight's Tour solutions
- **Interactive Visualization**: Watch the knight move through its optimal path
- **Beautiful UI**: Medieval-themed interface with animations and sound effects
- **Control Options**: Play, pause, and step through the solution
- **Sound Effects**: Immersive audio feedback for interactions

## 🛠️ Installation

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Pygame library

### Optional Resources (for enhanced experience)

Download these files and place them in the same directory as the script:

- **Images:**
  - `knight.png` - Knight chess piece image
  - `background.jpg` - Medieval/chess-themed background

- **Sounds:**
  - `click.wav` - Button click sound
  - `move.wav` - Knight movement sound
  - `success.wav` - Solution found sound


2. **Main Menu:**
   - Click "START TOUR" to begin the genetic algorithm
   - Enjoy the animated interface while the algorithm runs

3. **Solution Viewer:**
   - Watch the knight's optimal path animation
   - Use controls to interact with the visualization
   - Explore different viewing options

## 🧬 Algorithm Details

This project implements a complete genetic algorithm solution to the Knight's Tour problem:

- **Population-based approach** with selection, crossover, and mutation
- **Fitness evaluation** to guide the search toward optimal solutions
- **Move validation** to ensure legal knight movements
- **Efficient search** that typically finds solutions quickly

## 📁 Project Structure

The project consists of a single main Python file with optional resource files for enhanced experience.

## 🎯 How It Works

The application follows a clear workflow:

1. **Algorithm Execution**: The genetic algorithm searches for a complete knight's tour
2. **Solution Discovery**: Once found, the optimal path is stored
3. **Visualization**: The solution is presented in an interactive viewer
4. **User Interaction**: Users can explore the solution through various controls
